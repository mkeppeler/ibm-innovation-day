    The book list can be retrieved from the **api_url** [https://softwium.com/api/books](https://softwium.com/api/books) with the **request_method** `GET`

2.  Iterate through the response (list of books)

3.  Look for the number of pages the book has

4.  Create 2 arrays based on the page count of the books

    One that called **short_books** with book that have 400 or less pages and one called **long_books**
